Sudoku Final Project
Author: Nate Mondero

This project aims to create a GUI based Sudoku game.

src contains the java files

classes.java contains the implementation of the classes

classes_test.java contains the test class. It tests creating a board with any amount of valid
prefilled values. Note: There is no user input, so you must manually enter new numbers into 
the parameter GameBoard constructor between 0 and 81. 
It will output a console-based print of the gameboard as well as values in each row, column, and subgrid
